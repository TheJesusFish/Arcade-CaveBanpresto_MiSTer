# Cave 68000 Banpresto/Gazelle

This is a fork of Nullobject's [Cave68000 core](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-Cave_MiSTer) focused on supporting the Banpresto and Gazelle games. This core was split from the main core for timing and space reasons, but the majority of the code is still Nullobject's. Big thanks to them for all the hard work they put into the original core!

## Supported Games

| Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|

## Layout

- `rtl/` contains the active HDL. `rtl/cave/` is the hand-maintained Cave core.
- `sys/` is the MiSTer framework drop-in.
- `mra/` contains the active MRA files for the supported games.
- `cfg/` and `nvram/` contain the MiSTer config/NVRAM defaults used by those
  MRAs.
- `releases/` carries the release-side copies of the active MRAs.

## Build

Build the core with Quartus:

```sh
